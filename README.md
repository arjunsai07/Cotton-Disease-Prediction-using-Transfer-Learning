Cotton Disease Prediction using Transfer Learning


I worked on an image classification project for predicting cotton diseases on leaves and plants, focusing on 4 distinct output classes. The project involved employing advanced CNN models like ResNet50 and Inception V3 through transfer learning, to this dataset and deploying the model as an API using the Python Flask framework, with the model saved as a .h5 file.

I would like to take this opportunity to credit Akash Zade (https://lnkd.in/eFthQDpz) for the dataset. This experience has been a great learning opportunity and has deepened my understanding of CNNs and transfer learning.
